# 2D-Java-Slime-Game

A simple **Java 2D survival game** built with **Swing**.  
You play as a mage-slime who must **survive waves of slimes** while dodging arrows and progressing through levels.  
This was my **first game project in Java**, and it taught me about object-oriented programming, graphics, and basic game loops.
