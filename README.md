# 2D-Java-Slime-Game

A simple **Java 2D survival game** built with **Swing**.  
You play as a mage-slime who must **survive waves of slimes** while dodging arrows and progressing through levels.  
This was my **first game project in Java**, and it taught me about object-oriented programming, graphics, and basic game loops.

This is also my first GitHub repository, so I've been experimenting with the various Git commands as well as the features of this application.
